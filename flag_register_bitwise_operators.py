"""
Bitwise Operations with Simulated Flag Registers.

This program demonstrates how to use bitwise operations to manipulate specific
bits in 8-bit unsigned integers (values from 0 to 255) using bitmasks.
It began as a personal exploration and evolved into something I hope is educational.

Bitwise operators used:
    - |  (OR):    Set specific bits.
    - &  (AND):   Check or clear specific bits.
    - ~  (NOT):   Invert bits (used with AND to clear bits).
    - ^  (XOR):   Toggle bits; swap values without a temporary variable.
    - << (SHIFT): Define bitmasks using bitwise left shift.

Features:
    - Setting, clearing, and toggling individual bits using bitwise operators.
    - A bit toggle loop that iteratively toggles each bit.
    - The XOR Swap Algorithm (low-level approach), and a high-level alternative using tuple unpacking.

# This program demonstrates the use of bitwise operations 
# to manipulate specific bits in a flag register using bitmasks.


# ====== Bitmask Definitions ======
# Bitmasks are defined using left shift for reusability and clarity
MASK_0 = 1 << 0 # -> 0b00000001
MASK_1 = 1 << 1 # -> 0b00000010
MASK_2 = 1 << 2 # -> 0b00000100
MASK_3 = 1 << 3 # -> 0b00001000
MASK_4 = 1 << 4 # -> 0b00010000
MASK_5 = 1 << 5 # -> 0b00100000
MASK_6 = 1 << 6 # -> 0b01000000
MASK_7 = 1 << 7 # -> 0b10000000 (Included for completeness and for future use; unused)

# ====== XOR Swapping: Low-Level Approach ======
print("\n====== XOR Swapping ======")

# Initial values

print(f"Before XOR swap:    a = {a:08b} ({a}) ; b = {b:08b} ({b})")

# XOR Swap Algorithm â€” swaps values of two variables without using a temp variable.
# This technique is useful in low-level programming (e.g., C, assembly) under strict memory constraints.
a = a ^ b # a = 20 ^ 2 = 22
b = a ^ b # b = 22 ^ 2 = 20 (original a)
a = a ^ b # a = 22 ^ 20 = 2 (original b)
print(f"XOR Swap Algorithm; a = {a:08b} ({a}) ; b = {b:08b} ({b})")

# Note: The XOR swap assumes a and b are distinct values in memory.
# If they're not (e.g., a = 1 ; b = a), there is a significant risk of data loss
# or at the very least, meaningless results.


# ====== Pythonic Tuple Unpacking: High-Level Approach ======

# Reset values
c = 20
d = 2
print(f"\nBefore tuple unpacking: c = {c:08b} ({c}) ; d = {d:08b} ({d})")

# Idiomatic and Pythonic way to swap values
c, d = d, c 
print(f"After tuple unpacking:  c = {c:08b} ({c}) ; d = {d:08b} ({d})") # c = 2 ; d = 20

# This is a far more readable, concise, and Pythonic approach,
# and is preferred in high-level programming environments.
