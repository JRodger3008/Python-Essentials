# 2.6.9 LAB - Simple input and output.
# This is a simple program I wrote early in my learning, so I've picked up better practices since.
# I've left it mostly unchanged to document my progress.
# The program takes two user-defined float values and performs basic arithmetic operations on them.

# Input a float value for variable a
varA = float(input("Please enter a decimal number: "))
# Input a float value for variable b
varB = float(input("Please enter another decimal number: "))


# Output the result of varA + varB
print("Addition = " , varA + varB)

# Output the result of varA - varB
print("Subtraction = " , varA - varB)

# Output the result of varA * varB
print("Multiplication = " , varA * varB)

# Output the result of varA / varB
print("Division = " , varA / varB)

print("\nThat's all, folks!")
