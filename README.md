# Python Essentials 1 – Projects from Cisco/NetAcad Course

This repository contains a collection of Python programs I developed while completing the Python Essentials 1 course offered by Cisco Networking Academy (NetAcad).

The projects range from simple exercises designed to reinforce fundamental programming concepts - such as **variables**, **control flow**, **functions**, and **data structures** - to more exploratory projects I created independently. These personal additions include experiments with **bitwise operations**, **dictionary methods**, and more advanced **list comprehensions**.
I will continue uploading new files periodically, once complete and polished.

Whether you're reviewing core concepts or looking for practical examples, this collection reflects my journey through the essentials of Python, building on prior experience with JavaScript.
I've aimed to make the scripts both educational and useful for future reference - for myself and for others exploring similar topics.
Lastly, I’ve endeavored to write clear and informative documentation (docstrings and comments), which I hope will be helpful to anyone exploring my work.

## Projects Overview

-   [`basics`](./basics/) - Basic Python exercises; most of these were labs completed during Python Essentials 1 (PE1).
-   [`bubble_sort_algorithm`](./bubble_sort_algorithm/) - Exploration of the Bubble Sort Algorithm.
-   [`data-structures`](./data-structures/) - Implementations of Lists, Sets, Matrices, Tuples, and Dictionaries.
-   [`functions`](./functions/) - A range of programs utilising functions.
-   [`loops`](./loops/) - Exploration of loops; most files were labs completed during PE1.
-   [`math`](./math/) - Exploration of math operators, `math` module, and miscellaneous mathematical programs.
-   [`notable_projects`](./notable_projects/) - Projects that go beyond and expand on the PE1 syllabus; these have been my favourites to work on so far.

## Technologies Used

-   Python 3.6+ (tested with Python 3.13.3)
-   Python Standard Libraries (e.g., `math`, `operator`, `pprint`, `time`, `functools`, etc.)

---

## How to Use

-   Ensure Python Version 3.6+ is installed.
-   Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/JRodger3008/Python-Essentials.git
    ```
-   Navigate to a project folder and run scripts, for example:
    ```bash
    python dictionaries_colubrids.py
    ```
-   Most scripts require no additional setup or external libraries.

## Contribution

-   This is intended as a pedagogical exploration of Python for my own learning and others, not necessarily a collaborative repository. Though, I would gladly welcome collaboration on any future projects.
