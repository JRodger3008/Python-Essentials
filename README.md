# Python Essentials â€“ Projects from Cisco/NetAcad Course

This repository contains a collection of Python programs I developed while completing the Python Essentials course offered by Cisco Networking Academy (NetAcad).

The projects range from simple exercises designed to reinforce fundamental programming concepts - such as **variables**, **control flow**, **functions**, and **data structures** - to more exploratory projects I created independently. These personal additions include experiments with **bitwise operations**, **dictionary methods**, and more advanced **list comprehensions**.

Whether you're reviewing core concepts or looking for practical examples, this collection reflects my journey through the essentials of Python - coming from a background in JavaScript.
I've aimed to make the scripts both educational and useful for future reference - for myself and for others exploring similar topics.
