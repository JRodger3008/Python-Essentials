# Projects I've worked on for the Python Essentials Course (Cisco/NetAcad)

This repository contains a collection of Python programs I created while working through the Python Essentials course offered by Cisco/NetAcad.

Some of the projects are quite simple and focus on the fundamentals of Python programming. They were designed to demonstrate my understanding of core concepts such as variables, control flow, functions, and basic data structures.

In addition to the official course assignments, I’ve also included a few extra projects I built on my own to explore topics further — such as bitwise operations and more advanced list manipulations.
